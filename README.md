# Fake-news-detector

Fake News Detection Model using Python and TensorFlow:

Information that misdirects readers' attention is considered fake news. It may have negative repercussions that are intended to deceive others, attract attention, sway public opinion, or harm someone's reputation in the real world. In order for media outlets to be able to draw readers to their website and earn money from online advertising, it is essential to be able to identify fake news.

Tensorflow will be used to create a deep learning model that will be used to determine whether or not the news is fake.We will be using fake_news_dataset, which contains News text and corresponding label (FAKE or REAL). Dataset can be downloaded from link below:

The steps to be followed are : 

1.Importing Libraries and dataset
2.Preprocessing Dataset
3.Generating Word Embeddings
4.Model Architecture
5.Model Evaluation and Prediction
6.Importing Libraries and Dataset

The libraries we will be using are :

NumPy: To perform different mathematical functions. 
Pandas: To load dataset.
Tensorflow: To preprocessing the data and to create the model.
SkLearn: For train-test split and to import the modules for model evaluation.
